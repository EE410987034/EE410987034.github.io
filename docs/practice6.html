<h1>the weather has been good for almost a week,which is great.</h1>
  <p>with such a great weather,it would be nice to ride motorcycle or enjoy the view outside</p> <p>instead of staying in the accommodation.</p>
<h2>the first midterm exam of program design took place on october twenty seventh.</h2>
  <p>it was not difficult, but </p> <p>it was not easy as well.</p>
<h3>the free place for working out ,which is under the accommodation,doesn't open til 6:00p.m. to 9:00p.m. .</h3>
  <p>i do really try to lose weight. </p> <p>it's just all because of the time.</p>
